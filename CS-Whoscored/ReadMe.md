##### CornerStats' Whoscored ExG scraper

+ You need to know the 6 digit match id that is present in all Whoscored.com urls on the match pages
+ Enter this in the box that appears and click "ExG"
+ it then finds every shot made and categorises it in terms of definitions outlined by Michael Caley in http://cartilagefreecaptain.sbnation.com/2014/9/11/6131661/premier-league-projections-2014#methoderology 
+ and then applies his equations to work out the ExG for each shot. 
+ I have NOT added in the attack speed factor that he describes at the end.
